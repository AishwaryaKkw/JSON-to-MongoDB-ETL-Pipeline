JSON → MongoDB ETL Pipeline (Fitness Orders)

This mini-project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract → Transform → Load) pipeline using Python and MongoDB Atlas.
We use a sample dataset of fitness equipment orders, transform it by calculating totals, and load it into MongoDB.
Finally, we generate useful aggregated insights like customer spending, product sales, and total revenue.
